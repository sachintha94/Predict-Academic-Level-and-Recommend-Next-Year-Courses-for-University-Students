# **Predict Academic Level and Recommend Next Year Courses for University Students**

**A full-stack React and Python Flask system was developed to predict students' current academic level and recommend future courses using real MyOUSL data. Leveraging ML models like Random Forest, XGBoost, KNN, and GNN, it automates academic analysis, credit validation, and personalised course suggestions.**

**This project consists of two main tasks. In the first, students can directly enter their completed compulsory and elective subjects, and the system will predict their current academic level. In the second, students can upload their MyOUSL result Excel sheet, and the system will predict their academic level and recommend subjects they can register for in the next academic year.**
